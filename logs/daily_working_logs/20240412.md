- What I did today
    * Jaeho discussed DiT in today weekly meeting. The presentation emphasized DiT's patchify and transformer decoder function.

- What I learn today
    * In patching, an image is divided into smaller patches, typically squares, each with a part of the original image. These patches are then flattened into sequences of vectors, which then go into the transformer model.
