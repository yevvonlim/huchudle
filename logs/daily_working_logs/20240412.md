  * Hailey prepared for presentation. 
- What I learned today
  * Hailey learned about how latent space works in Stable Diffusion model.
  * By implementing latent space, the image generation task got higher scalabilty because of the computing efficiency.
  * Latent space got a text embedding vector as a input, and do denoising process by Unet structure, then generate a latent vector that fed into the decoder, which is the image generation part.
