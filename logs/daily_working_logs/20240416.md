- What I did today

    * Jaeho prepare about 'Sora seminar' for tomorrow.

- What I learn today
    * Sora is diffusion transformer.
    * The diffusion model is obtain the generate image from the noise image learning through forward process.
    * It adds Gaussian noise for forward process, and reverse process, which is opposite process.

- What I did today

    * Yoojeong developed a model modifying models.py and train.py.
    * Yoojeong used DiT model and Stable diffusion model for building a model, which fit in COCO dataset.

- What I did today
  * Hailey modified the train code of DiT that matches with our COCO dataset.
  * Hailey created a new dataclass which fits our data, then change the data loader part in DiT train code.
  * Now the new data class gets an output as a image and caption, instead of class data which was the output of DiT.
