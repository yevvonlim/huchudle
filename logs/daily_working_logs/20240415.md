- What I did today
    * Jaeho study about Sora. Markov chain are used when it processing images.

- What I learn today
    * How the Markov chain was repeatedly applied to the origin image, it can use the inverse function on the noise image to get back the origin image.

- What I did today
  * Hailey studied about GAN model. 
- What I learned today
  * Hailey learned about how GAN works compared to Stable Diffusion model.
  * GAN trains two neural networks to compete against each other.
  * Then it generates more authentic new data from a given training dataset.
