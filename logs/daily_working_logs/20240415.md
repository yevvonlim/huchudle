- What I did today

    * Yoojeong studied Generative Adversarial Nets(GAN) by reviewing Goodfellow, I., Pouget-Abadie, J., Mirza, M., Xu, B., Warde-Farley, D., Ozair, S., ... & Bengio, Y. (2014). Generative adversarial nets. Advances in neural information processing systems, 27.
    * GAN is training Discriminator and Generator adversarially, called two-player minimax game. In result optimizing both discriminator and generator well.
    * Yoojeong apprehended GAN in Mathematically, optimizing Disriminator parameter D and Generator parameter G.

$$\min_G \max_D V(D,G) = \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_{data}(x)}[\log D(x)] + \mathbb{E}_{z \sim p_z(z)}[\log(1 - D(G(z)))]
$$

- What I did today
    * Jaeho study about Sora. Markov chain are used when it processing images.

- What I learn today
    * How the Markov chain was repeatedly applied to the origin image, it can use the inverse function on the noise image to get back the origin image.

### 2024-04-15 EST 17:00 [Hailey]

- What I did today
  * Hailey studied about GAN model. 
- What I learned today
  * Hailey learned about how GAN works compared to Stable Diffusion model.
  * GAN trains two neural networks to compete against each other.
  * Then it generates more authentic new data from a given training dataset.
