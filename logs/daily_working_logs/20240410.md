- What I did today

    * I studied about difference with Stable Diffusion and DiT. 

    * Stable Diffusion model is the most popular model in text-to-image before DiT. Stable Diffusion uses VAE auto encoder, and encodes image to latent vector. Then this model performs diffusion process in a latent vector. 
    > I don't know why It is better when model uses latent vector.. 
   
    * Stable Diffusion model's backbone architecture is U-Net. 

    * DiT is Scalable Diffusion model with Transformer. So unlike Stable Diffusion, DiT's backbone architecture is transformer. Specifically, Vision Transformer.
      
    * In DiT, they use latent diffusion. Latent diffusion is a method when image generate.. Compress the image and through latent, it can reconstruct image. In compressing and reconstruct image progress, they use VAE auto encoder. Our team would use pre-trained VAE auto encoder.
      
    * We should train latent diffusion using DiT diffusion.
