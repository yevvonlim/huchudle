- What I did today
    * Haeyeon studied about the differences between Stable Diffusion and DiT. 

    * The Stable Diffusion model is the most popular model in text-to-image generation. Stable Diffusion uses VAE, and encodes image to a latent vector. Then this model performs the diffusion process in a latent vector.  
   
    * The Stable Diffusion model's architecture is U-Net. 

    * DiT is a scalable diffusion model with a transformer. Unlike Stable Diffusion, DiT's architecture is a transformer. Specifically, Vision Transformer. 
      
    * We should train latent diffusion using DiT diffusion.

- What I did today
    * Jaeho created the 'Customdataset class' that can receive images and descriptions at the same time.

- What I did today
    * Yoojeong started to develop a python class that utilizes the COCO dataset that contains images and text descriptions. 
    * Yoojeong studied how Stable Diffusion dataloader works in the model, tried to figure out how the COCO dataset integrates in the model. 
    * In the Stable Diffusion model, the authors use a config file and dataloader class for using general data in Stable Diffusion model.

- What I did today
    - Dayeon started to make a dataset class that enables the team to work on the dataset.
    - Instead of using a DataLoader dataset class that was used in DiT, we had to create our own dataset class. So I researched examples of a class dataset and studied the documents that were provided.
