- What I did today

    * Haeyeon studied about difference with Stable Diffusion and DiT. 

    * Stable Diffusion model is the most popular model in text-to-image before DiT. Stable Diffusion uses VAE auto encoder, and encodes image to latent vector. Then this model performs diffusion process in a latent vector.  
   
    * Stable Diffusion model's backbone architecture is U-Net. 

    * DiT is Scalable Diffusion model with Transformer. Unlike Stable Diffusion, DiT's backbone architecture is transformer. Specifically, Vision Transformer. 
      
    * We should train latent diffusion using DiT diffusion.

- What I did today

    * Jaeho created a 'Customdataset class' that can receive images and descriptions at the same time.

- What I did today

    * Yoojeong started to develop 'dataset class' of COCO dataset for using images and text description to our model. 
    * Yoojeong studied how Stable Diffusion dataloader works in the model, try to figure out COCO dataset can work in the our model. 
    * In the Stable Diffusion model they use config file and dataloader class for using general data in Stable Diffusion model.

- What I did today
    - Dayeon started to make a dataset class that ables to work on our dataset.
    - Instead of using a DataLoader dataset class that was used in DiT, we had to custom our own dataset class. So I do research about examples of class dataset and studied about the documents that was provided.
