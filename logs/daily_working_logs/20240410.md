- What I did today

    * I studied about difference with Stable Diffusion and DiT. 

    * Stable Diffusion model is the most popular model in text-to-image before DiT. Stable Diffusion uses VAE auto encoder, and encodes image to latent vector. Then this model performs diffusion process in a latent vector.  
   
    * Stable Diffusion model's backbone architecture is U-Net. 

    * DiT is Scalable Diffusion model with Transformer. So unlike Stable Diffusion, DiT's backbone architecture is transformer. Specifically, Vision Transformer.
      
    * In DiT, they use latent diffusion. Latent diffusion is a method when image generate.. Compress the image and through latent, it can reconstruct image. In compressing and reconstructing image progress, they use VAE auto encoder. Our team would use pre-trained VAE auto encoder.
      
    * We should train latent diffusion using DiT diffusion.

    * Jaeho created a 'Customdataset class' that can receive images and descriptions at the same time.

- What I did today

    * Yoojeong started to develop 'dataset class' of COCO dataset for using images and text description to our model. 
    * Yoojeong studied how Stable Diffusion dataloader works in the model, try to figure out COCO dataset can work in the our model. 
    * In the Stable Diffusion model they use config file and dataloader class for using general data in Stable Diffusion model.
