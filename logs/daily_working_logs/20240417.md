- What I did today
  * Hailey implement the text embedding in the DiT train model.
  * Hailey refered the DiT pipeline that we customed previously, but modified to match with the new train model.
  * For example, Hailey modified ```y_embedder``` in the model code by using our customized Text Embedder class. 
  * Inside of the customized Text Embedder class, Hailey created a new embedding function which is able to get a prompt text data and embed into tensor. 
  * Then Hailey updated the forward function to use this new embedding function.
