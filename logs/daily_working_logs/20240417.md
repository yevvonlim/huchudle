- What I did today

    * Yoojeong developed text embedders class to tokenize text explanation with CLIP tokenizer and embed using CLIP processor.
    * Yoojeong fixed OS error which is origin from environment variable.

- What I did today
    * Jaeho presentataion about 'Sora' for seminer. For this seminer Jaeho also explain about Markov Chain, diffusion model, stable diffusion, and ViViT.

- What I learn today
    * A Markov chain is a type of model that describes a series of events where each event's likelihood only depends on what happened before it.

- What I did today
  * Hailey implement the text embedding in the DiT train model.
  * Hailey refered the DiT pipeline that we customed previously, but modified to match with the new train model.
  * For example, Hailey modified ```y_embedder``` in the model code by using our customized Text Embedder class. 
  * Inside of the customized Text Embedder class, Hailey created a new embedding function which is able to get a prompt text data and embed into tensor. 
  * Then Hailey updated the forward function to use this new embedding function.
