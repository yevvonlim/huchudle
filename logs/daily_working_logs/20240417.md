- What I did today

    * Yoojeong developed text embedders class to tokenize text explanation with CLIP tokenizer and embed using CLIP processor.
    * Yoojeong fixed OS error which is origin from environment variable.

- What I did today
    * Jaeho presentataion about 'Sora' for seminer. For this seminer Jaeho also explain about Markov Chain, diffusion model, stable diffusion, and ViViT.

- What I learn today
    * A Markov chain is a type of model that describes a series of events where each event's likelihood only depends on what happened before it.

- What I did today
  * Hailey implement the text embedding in the DiT train model.
  * Hailey refered the DiT pipeline that we customed previously, but modified to match with the new train model.
  * For example, Hailey modified ```y_embedder``` in the model code by using our customized Text Embedder class. 
  * Inside of the customized Text Embedder class, Hailey created a new embedding function which is able to get a prompt text data and embed into tensor. 
  * Then Hailey updated the forward function to use this new embedding function. 

### 2024-04-09 EST 17:00 [Haeyeon]
- What I did today
    * Haeyeon searched about Sora. 
    * Haeyeon searched text to image model's tendency.

- Sora
    * Sora wants to explore large-scale training of generative models on video data. Large-scale training uses large dataset when a model is trained. Sora is a diffusion model with a transformer backbone, DiT. 
    * Diffusion model's process uses Marcov chain.  

- Text to-image model's tendency
    *  1) GLIDE (Submitted on 12/20/2021)
    GLIDE is text guided model. GLIDE uses transformer model to embed text caption in text condition. And through diffusion model, it generated 64x64 image. Then upscaling image 64x64 to 256x256 using super resolution. 

    *  2) Imagen (Submitted on 5/23/2022)
    They use CLIP pretrained model when text embedding. So that Imagen can generate more various images than before tti models.
    And they can generate high resolution images 1024x1024 by using two super resolutions.

    *  3) Stable Diffusion (Submitted on 12/20/2021)
    Stable Diffusion is a latent diffusion model. They predict each pixels using auto-encoder. 
    They don't need super resolution. 
    Stable Diffusion is one of the latent diffusion model. Latent diffusion model is not reconstruct image derectly, reconstruct latent vector and go through VAE(auto encoder) and generate imgaes.
    They only handle one condition. For example text, class and bounding box. 

    *  4) GLIGEN 
    Thay can handle more than one condition, so called Multimodal condition.
