- What I did today

    * I wirte code in DiT training code to get image and description for input

    * Stable Diffusion model is the most popular model in text-to-image before DiT. Stable Diffusion uses VAE auto encoder, and encodes image to latent vector. Then this model performs diffusion process in a latent vector. 
    > I don't know why It is better when model uses latent vector..
