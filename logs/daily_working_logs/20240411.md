- What I did today
    * Dayeon completed to make a custom dataset class.
    * Dayeon made a testcode to check the class that I made works properly.
    * Dayeon started to train the model with the dataset we collected last time, the data class that I customed, with the model pipeline that we programmed last time.
    * Dayeon tried to make a model that was based on DiT pipeline but using our text embedding method with text discription data.
