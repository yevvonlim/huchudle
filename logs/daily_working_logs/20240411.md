- What I did today

    * Jaeho added 'class Customdataset' code to the DiT training code to receive images and explanations at the same time for input.
    > It succeeded in getting the input, but still can't train it.

    * Jaeho prepared the presentation for tomorrow.

    * Dayeon completed the custom dataset class.
    * Dayeon made the testing code to check that the custom dataset class works.
    * Dayeon started to train the model with the dataset we collected last time, the data class that I designed, with the model pipeline that we programmed.
    * Dayeon tried to make a model that was based on DiT pipeline but used our text embedding method with text description data.
