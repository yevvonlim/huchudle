- What I did today
    * Austin wrote a dit-text conditioned model using diffusers and test code for the model.

- Progress
   * Hailey and Yoojeong tried to fit COCO dataset into the model pipeline. 
   * Hailey and Yoojeong focused on the DataLoader & ImageFolder part to see how they managed their data as an input on DiT & Stable Diffusion model.
   * Hailey wrote the baseline test code to check how to load the image and text data together for unit testing.
  
- What We Learned Today 
   * Hailey and Yoojeong learned how the dataset loads in the model (DiT & Stable diffusion).
   * Hailey and Yoojeong created a class that processes the dataset by using pytorch. This class takes in an image and caption and ouput the combined captioned image for each element in the dataset.

- What I Did Today 
    * Jaeho tried to train a model (test_train.py) based on the DiT_train.py model to check how to use Pil image dataset.
 
### 2024-04-09 EST 17:00 [Haeyeon]
- What I Did Today 
    * Haeyeon tried to understand differences between text-to-image training code using the Diffusers library and DiT training code. 
    * Haeyeon tried to understand how the model loads the image and text description dataset.
