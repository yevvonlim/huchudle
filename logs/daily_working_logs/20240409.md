- What I did today
    * Austin wrote a dit-text conditioned model using diffusers and test code for the model.

- Progress
   * Hailey and Yoojeong tried to use our COCO dataset into the model pipeline that we made last time 
   * Hailey and Yoojeong focused on the DataLoader & ImageFolder part to see how they manage their data as an input on DiT & Stable Diffusion model
   * Hailey wrote the base line testcode to check how to load the image and text data all together and to unit testing
  
- What I have learned today 
   * Hailey and Yoojeong learned how dataset loads in the model (DiT & Stable diffusion) and decided to make  data set class by using pytorch

- What I did today
    * Jaeho try to make a train model refer on DiT_train.py and wrote a test_train code to check how to use Pil image dataset.
 
### 2024-04-09 EST 17:00 [Haeyeon]
- What I did today
    * Haeyeon try to undestand difference between text-to-image train code using diffusers library and DiT train code. 
    * Haeyeon try to understand how can model call image and text description dataset. And I searched about it.
